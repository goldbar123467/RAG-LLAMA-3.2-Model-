## 🚀 Overview

**MyAgent** is a personal AI development project built entirely over a weekend — combining Python, Hugging Face tools, and local GPU workflows to **merge and deploy custom LoRA fine-tuned models**.  

The goal was to automate the process of merging lightweight adapters, testing inference locally, and publishing to the Hugging Face Hub. This project taught me how to move from idea → working AI toolchain — covering dataset management, model compatibility, and deployment automation.

## 🧩 Key Features

- 🔗 **LoRA Model Merging** — Combines multiple LoRA adapters into a single unified model.  
- ⚙️ **Adapter Offload Management** — Handles `meta` and offloaded layers seamlessly.  
- 🧰 **One-Click Upload** — Automated push to Hugging Face with `huggingface_hub`.  
- 🧮 **GPU-Optimized** — Built and tested locally on RTX hardware (PyTorch + CUDA).  
- 💾 **Safe Checkpointing** — Creates intermediate backups for rollback and testing.  
- 📊 **Readable, Modular Code** — Each component split into logical Python scripts.
